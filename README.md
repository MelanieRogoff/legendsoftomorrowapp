This app is called, **"Legends of Tomorrow Employee Directory"**. The directory, created by Melanie Rogoff, is inspired by DC/CW's TV series, last week, *"Legends of Tomorrow" (LOT)*. The app embraces responsive web design methodologies in order to allow users to view, sort, and filter various characters from LOT by categories on any device, all while listening to a theme song through the app itself.

The characters and the show, *"Legends of Tomorrow"* are the property and copyright of the TV show and its creators.
